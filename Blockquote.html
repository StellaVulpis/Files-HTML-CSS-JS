[Update announcement]
After version 2.0.0, new races were added on this race replacer, 
therefore you need to install two additional race mods for this mod to work properly. (If you only want 3 races(Cellan/Lykaios/Fennec), you can simply download
older version of files on Nexus files tab.(v1.1.0 / v1.0.0 are available))
